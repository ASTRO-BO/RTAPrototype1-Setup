1. INTRODUCTION

RTAPrototype1-Setup build the RTA first prototype for the CTA Project. It is based on ZeroC ICE as a middleware for communication and uses chaco for realtime plotting.

2. QUICK START

You just need to check for the requirements before the setup launch.

3. REQUIREMENTS

Basic requirements for "minimal" version:
	cmake
    cfitsio
	root 5
	ZerocIce 3.5

For "nogui" version you need also:
    python 2.7
    pyfits

For "complete" version (with gui) you need also:
    pyqt4
    chaco

On Mac OS X all the packages are cmake cfitsio root5 py27-zeroc-ice35 py27-pyqt4 py27-chaco py27-pyfits. Remember to select the correct python27 using 'sudo port select python python27'.

Optional requirements:
    doxygen (1.8)
    boost

4. COMPILATION / SETUP

To install the prototype you just need to run the install script:

	./install

You have some options for the build, for example if you want to change the prefix use -p:

Usage: ./install [-hsdv] [-p PREFIX] [-n NUMTHREADS] [clean|minimal|nogui]
    -h             print this help
    -p PREFIX      set installation prefix, default is $HOME/local.rtaproto1
    -n NUMTHREADS  default number of threads is the number of cores
    -d             compile with debug
    -s             skip download/update
    -v             verbose output

The "nogui" option means you don't want to install the gui part (python viewers) and the "minimal" means no gui and no RTAtelem.

5. RUNNING PROGRAMS

In order to run the Quick Look on a Linux platform you need to export the following environment:

    export CTARTA=<prefix>
    export ICE_HOME=<ice_home_path>
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CTARTA/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you are running MacOS X you will need also:

    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CTARTA/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

and sometimes it is required to load the fallback profile in order to work. The following is used on abmac2:

    . ~/profile.port
    export CTARTA=/install/path
    export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:$CTARTA/lib

Eventually, to run the the complete prototype you need just to:

   ./rtaproto1_gui data.raw

where the data.raw file is the input file for the EB Simulator could be generated using RTAencoder or RTAencoderRoot.

For the command line version (if you have no gui installed):

	./rtaproto1 data.raw

If you have some troubles during the launch of the processes you can see the logs directory for details.

To kill all the processes of the prototype you can use:

    ./rtaproto1 -k
