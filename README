1. INTRODUCTION

RTAPrototypeV1-Setup build the RTA prototype for the CTA Project.

The submodules are free software, released under the GNU GPL 2. See the LICENSE file present within the submodules.

2. QUICK START

In order to download the submodules required for the installation process you need to run:

    git submodule update --init

3. REQUIREMENTS

Basic requirements for "minimal" version:
    cfitsio
	root 5
	ZerocIce 3.5

For "nogui" version you need also:
    python 2.7
    pyfits

For "complete" version (with gui) you need also:
    pyqt4
    chaco

On Mac OS X all the packages are cfitsio root5 py27-zeroc-ice35 py27-pyqt4 py27-chaco py27-pyfits. Remember to select the correct python27 using 'sudo port select python python27'.

Optional requirements:
    doxygen (1.8)
    boost

4. COMPILATION / SETUP

In order to build the submodules you need to set a common path of installation and set compiler environment.

    export CTARTA=/install/path
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
    export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CTARTA/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
    export LIBRARY_PATH=$CTARTA/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH

For the "minimal" installation you have to run:

	./install.sh minimal

For the "nogui" installation run:

	./install.sh nogui


For the "complete" installation run:

    ./install.sh

5. RUNNING PROGRAMS

In order to run the Quick Look on a Linux platform you need to append $ASTRI/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

    export CTARTA=/install/path
    export ICE_HOME=/opt/local
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CTARTA/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CTARTA/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH


Sometimes it is useful to load the fallback profile. The following is used on abmac2:

    . ~/profile.port
    export CTARTA=/install/path
    export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:$CTARTA/lib

Eventually, to run the the complete prototype you need just to:

   ./runPrototype.sh data.raw

where the data.raw file is the input file for the EB Simulator could be generated using RTAencoder or RTAencoderRoot.

For the command line version (if you have no gui installed):

	./runPrototypeCommandLine.sh data.raw

If you have some troubles during the launch of the processes you can see the logs directory for details.

To kill all the processes of the prototype you can use:

    ./runPrototype.sh -k
